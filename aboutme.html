        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-pic">
        <p >I’m Gauri Jadhav, a passionate web developer and a SY BSC IT student at B. K. Birla College,
             Mumbai University. With a strong foundation in technology and a love for continuous learning, 
             I aim to craft meaningful digital solutions that make a difference.
    <br>
            I specialize in designing and developing user-friendly websites, with a focus on helping
             small-scale businesses establish their online presence affordably. Beyond coding, 
             I’m deeply inspired by teaching and aspire to become a professor in the future,
              sharing knowledge and empowering others to succeed.
            <br>
            When I’m not immersed in web development, I enjoy exploring new places to gain fresh perspectives,
             working on creative projects, and leveraging AI tools to generate unique content.
              My journey is driven by hard work, curiosity, and a commitment to achieving both personal 
              and professional growth.
            
            Let’s connect and create something incredible together!</p>
